## October 5, 2025 - Image Upload Performance Optimization

### Instant Preview Implementation

Dramatically improved image upload UX with instant local preview:

âœ“ **Before:** Preview only showed after full upload to Supabase (slow, 3-5+ seconds)
âœ“ **After:** Preview appears instantly using local blob URL while upload happens in background

**Implementation Details:**

- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` for instant local preview
- Supabase upload runs in parallel (background)
- Once upload completes, swaps blob URL to public URL
- Proper cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to prevent memory leaks
- Graceful error handling reverts preview on upload failure

**Benefits:**

- Preview feels instant (< 100ms)
- Better perceived performance
- Users can continue filling form while upload completes
- No actual upload speed change, just better UX
- Simple, non-overengineered solution (30 lines of code)

## October 5, 2025 - Gemini AI Photo Analysis Integration

### AI-Powered Item Upload

Integrated Google Gemini AI to automatically analyze uploaded photos and auto-fill item details:

âœ“ **Features:**

- "Analyze Photo with AI" button on upload form
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model for fast, accurate analysis
- Auto-fills: Title, Category, Description, Hidden Notes
- New title field added to items
- Simple, non-overengineered implementation

**Implementation:**

- Created `/lib/gemini.js` wrapper for Gemini API
- Modified `ImageUpload` component to pass File object for AI analysis
- Added title field to upload form and database schema
- **Automatic instant analysis** - triggers as soon as photo is selected
- Runs in parallel with Supabase upload for maximum speed
- Clean JSON response parsing with error handling

**Setup:**

1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
2. Run `instructions/add-title-migration.sql` in Supabase to add title column
3. Upload photo - AI analysis starts automatically
4. Review and edit AI-generated fields before saving

**Benefits:**

- Saves admin time on data entry
- Clean, human-friendly descriptions (1-2 lines, no photo commentary)
- Focuses on item details: type, color, brand, condition, unique markings
- Better identification with hidden notes
- Automatic - no button clicks needed
- Keeps existing manual editing capability

**Updated Categories:**

Replaced generic categories with more specific, descriptive ones:

- Clothing (hoodies, jackets, hats, gloves)
- Devices (phones, laptops, headphones, AirPods, calculators)
- Cables & Accessories (chargers, dongles, adapters, power banks)
- Essentials (wallets, keys, IDs, glasses)
- Daily Items (water bottles, mugs, umbrellas)
- Other

Gemini prompt updated with explicit categorization rules to ensure consistency (e.g., cables always go in "Cables & Accessories", never in "Devices").

## October 5, 2025 - Mobile Camera & Photo Library Support

### Enhanced Image Upload for Mobile

Improved ImageUpload component to explicitly support camera and photo library on mobile devices:

âœ“ **Changes:**

- Added `capture="environment"` attribute to file input for direct camera access
- Changed icon from generic image to camera icon for clarity
- Updated button text: "Take Photo or Upload" (instead of just "Upload Photo")
- Updated help text to explicitly mention: "Camera, Photo Library, or Files"

**How it works:**

- **iPhone:** Tapping the upload button shows action sheet with "Take Photo", "Photo Library", and "Browse" options
- **Android:** Tapping shows similar options: "Camera", "Gallery", and "Files"
- **Desktop:** Shows standard file picker (camera icon still makes sense for photo uploads)

**Technical Details:**

- Uses HTML5 `<input type="file" accept="image/*">`
- The `accept="image/*"` attribute automatically provides both camera and photo library options on mobile
- Works universally across iOS Safari, Chrome, Android browsers
- No additional dependencies or native app code needed
- Maintains existing instant preview and Gemini AI analysis features

**Note:** Removed `capture` attribute as it was restricting some browsers to camera-only mode. Without it, mobile browsers correctly show both "Take Photo" and "Choose from Library" options.

## October 5, 2025 - AI Analysis Cancellation

### Cancel Button for AI Analysis

Added ability to cancel AI analysis while it's loading:

âœ“ **Features:**

- Cancel button appears next to "AI analyzing photo..." message
- Simple, intuitive design with clear "Cancel" label
- Immediately stops the AI analysis when clicked
- Uses AbortController for clean cancellation
- No error messages when cancelled by user

**Implementation:**

- Added abort signal support to `analyzeFoundItem()` function
- Checks cancellation at multiple points during analysis
- Cancel button in blue notification bar with white background
- Touch-optimized button sizing and spacing
- Graceful cleanup of abort controller

**Benefits:**

- Users can skip AI analysis if it's taking too long
- Can manually enter details instead of waiting
- Simple, non-overengineered solution
- No unnecessary error logging for user cancellations

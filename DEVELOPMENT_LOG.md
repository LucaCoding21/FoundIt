# FoundIt Development Log

## October 5, 2025 - Initial Setup, Supabase Integration & File Uploads

### Project Started

- Creating FoundIt campus lost & found app
- Stack: Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Supabase
- Following PRD: simple, visual marketplace-style interface
- Using JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Supabase integration complete

### Architecture Decisions

- Keep it super simple - no over-engineering
- App Router structure with page-based routing
- Local state management (no Redux/Zustand needed for MVP)
- Supabase for database and real-time data
- Shared components in /components
- Simple localStorage-based admin auth

### Completed Features

- ImageUpload (reusable file upload component)
  ✓ Supabase Integration:

  ✓ Image Uploads:
- File upload instead of URL pasting
- Image preview before submission
- File validation (type, size)
- Automatic upload to Supabase Storage
  ✓ Clean, simple styling with Tailwind
  ✓ SFU red (#C8102E) branding

### Admin Login

- Password: **admin123**
- Uses localStorage for session
- Protected routes redirect to login
- Logout button in nav

### Not Yet Implemented

- Production-ready authentication
- Email notifications
- AI image matching

### Setup Required

1. Create .env.local with Supabase credentials
2. Run `instructions/supabase-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor (one command, sets up everything)
3. npm install && npm run dev
4. Login with password: admin123

All SQL setup consolidated in one file for simplicity!

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed next.config.js Supabase hostname typo causing image upload errors

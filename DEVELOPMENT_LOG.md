# FoundIt Development Log

## October 5, 2025 - Report Resolution Refresh Fix

### Fixed Reports Not Refreshing After Marking as Resolved

Fixed bug where resolved reports still appeared in the admin reports list:

✓ **Issue:**

- Marking a report as resolved deleted it from database
- But reports page didn't refresh to show updated list
- Stale data remained visible until manual page refresh

✓ **Solution:**

- Added `?refresh=true` query parameter when navigating back
- Reports page detects refresh param and refetches data
- URL cleaned up automatically after refresh
- Simple, non-overengineered solution

**Files Updated:**

- `/app/admin/matches/[reportId]/page.js` - Add refresh param to redirect
- `/app/admin/reports/page.js` - Detect refresh param and auto-refresh

**Result:**

- Reports list automatically updates when marking as resolved
- Clean user experience with no stale data
- URL stays clean without visible query params

## October 5, 2025 - Student Report Submission Bug Fix

### Fixed 400 Error When Submitting Reports

Fixed critical bug preventing students from submitting lost item reports:

✓ **Issue:**

- Students received 400 error when submitting reports
- Error message mentioned "created_at" in URL
- Manual `created_at` timestamp conflicted with Supabase defaults

✓ **Solution:**

- Removed manual `created_at: new Date().toISOString()` from insert
- Let Supabase handle timestamp automatically with default value
- Supabase columns with default values should not be manually set

✓ **Technical Details:**

- RLS policies may prevent manual setting of certain fields
- Database columns with defaults (like `now()`) handle timestamps automatically
- Manually setting can cause format or permission conflicts

**Files Updated:**

- `/app/report/page.js` - Removed manual created_at field

**Result:**

- Student report submissions now work correctly
- Clean error-free submission flow
- Automatic timestamp handling by Supabase

## October 5, 2025 - Service Worker Bug Fix

### Critical Bug Fix for Form Submissions

Fixed service worker causing report submission failures:

✓ **Issues Found:**

- Service worker was trying to cache POST requests (not allowed by browsers)
- Caused "Failed to execute 'put' on 'Cache': Request method 'POST' is unsupported" error
- Blocked form submissions and Supabase API calls
- Missing PWA icons causing 404 errors

✓ **Service Worker Fixes:**

- Now only caches GET requests (skips POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Skips caching all Supabase API requests (supabase.co domain)
- Only caches successful responses (status 200)
- Prevents interference with form submissions and database operations
- Bumped cache version to v2 for automatic update

✓ **PWA Manifest Fix:**

- Removed icon references (icon-192.png, icon-512.png) temporarily
- Icons can be added later without breaking functionality
- Prevents 404 errors in console
- PWA still works, just without custom home screen icons

**Implementation:**

- Updated `/public/sw.js` with proper request filtering
- Updated `/public/manifest.json` to remove missing icons
- Simple, defensive caching strategy
- No more interference with API calls

**Result:**

- Report submissions now work correctly
- Forms submit without service worker errors
- Clean console without 404 errors
- PWA functionality maintained

## October 5, 2025 - Image Upload Performance Optimization

### Instant Preview Implementation

Dramatically improved image upload UX with instant local preview:

✓ **Before:** Preview only showed after full upload to Supabase (slow, 3-5+ seconds)
✓ **After:** Preview appears instantly using local blob URL while upload happens in background

**Implementation Details:**

- Uses `URL.createObjectURL()` for instant local preview
- Supabase upload runs in parallel (background)
- Once upload completes, swaps blob URL to public URL
- Proper cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to prevent memory leaks
- Graceful error handling reverts preview on upload failure

**Benefits:**

- Preview feels instant (< 100ms)
- Better perceived performance
- Users can continue filling form while upload completes
- No actual upload speed change, just better UX
- Simple, non-overengineered solution (30 lines of code)

## October 5, 2025 - Gemini AI Photo Analysis Integration

### AI-Powered Item Upload

Integrated Google Gemini AI to automatically analyze uploaded photos and auto-fill item details:

✓ **Features:**

- "Analyze Photo with AI" button on upload form
- Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model for fast, accurate analysis
- Auto-fills: Title, Category, Description, Hidden Notes
- New title field added to items
- Simple, non-overengineered implementation

**Implementation:**

- Created `/lib/gemini.js` wrapper for Gemini API
- Modified `ImageUpload` component to pass File object for AI analysis
- Added title field to upload form and database schema
- **Automatic instant analysis** - triggers as soon as photo is selected
- Runs in parallel with Supabase upload for maximum speed
- Clean JSON response parsing with error handling

**Setup:**

1. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
2. Run `instructions/add-title-migration.sql` in Supabase to add title column
3. Upload photo - AI analysis starts automatically
4. Review and edit AI-generated fields before saving

**Benefits:**

- Saves admin time on data entry
- Clean, human-friendly descriptions (1-2 lines, no photo commentary)
- Focuses on item details: type, color, brand, condition, unique markings
- Better identification with hidden notes
- Automatic - no button clicks needed
- Keeps existing manual editing capability

**Updated Categories:**

Replaced generic categories with more specific, descriptive ones:

- Clothing (hoodies, jackets, hats, gloves)
- Devices (phones, laptops, headphones, AirPods, calculators)
- Cables & Accessories (chargers, dongles, adapters, power banks)
- Essentials (wallets, keys, IDs, glasses)
- Daily Items (water bottles, mugs, umbrellas)
- Other

Gemini prompt updated with explicit categorization rules to ensure consistency (e.g., cables always go in "Cables & Accessories", never in "Devices").

## October 5, 2025 - Mobile Camera & Photo Library Support

### Enhanced Image Upload for Mobile

Improved ImageUpload component to explicitly support camera and photo library on mobile devices:

✓ **Changes:**

- Added `capture="environment"` attribute to file input for direct camera access
- Changed icon from generic image to camera icon for clarity
- Updated button text: "Take Photo or Upload" (instead of just "Upload Photo")
- Updated help text to explicitly mention: "Camera, Photo Library, or Files"

**How it works:**

- **iPhone:** Tapping the upload button shows action sheet with "Take Photo", "Photo Library", and "Browse" options
- **Android:** Tapping shows similar options: "Camera", "Gallery", and "Files"
- **Desktop:** Shows standard file picker (camera icon still makes sense for photo uploads)

**Technical Details:**

- Uses HTML5 `<input type="file" accept="image/*">`
- The `accept="image/*"` attribute automatically provides both camera and photo library options on mobile
- Works universally across iOS Safari, Chrome, Android browsers
- No additional dependencies or native app code needed
- Maintains existing instant preview and Gemini AI analysis features

**Note:** Removed `capture` attribute as it was restricting some browsers to camera-only mode. Without it, mobile browsers correctly show both "Take Photo" and "Choose from Library" options.

## October 5, 2025 - AI Analysis Cancellation

✓ **Features:**

- Can manually enter details instead of waiting
- Simple, non-overengineered solution
- No unnecessary error logging for user cancellations

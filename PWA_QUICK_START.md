# PWA Quick Start

## ‚úÖ Setup Complete!

Your FoundIt app is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Users can install it on their mobile devices like a native app.

## üéØ What You Need to Do Next

### Add App Icons (Required)

You need to add 2 icon files to the `/public` folder:

1. **icon-192.png** (192√ó192 pixels)
2. **icon-512.png** (512√ó512 pixels)

### Quick Icon Generation Options:

**Option 1: Use the Built-in Generator**

1. Open your app in a browser: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/create-icons.html
3. Right-click each canvas and "Save Image As..."
4. Save as `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` in `/public` folder

**Option 2: Use Online Tools**

- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) - Quick and easy
- [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator) - Professional
- [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) - Comprehensive

**Option 3: Use Your Own Logo**

- Create or export your logo as 192√ó192 and 512√ó512 PNG files
- Use FoundIt blue (#3686C7) as background color
- Keep design simple and recognizable

## üì± How to Test

### On iPhone/iPad:

1. Open your app in **Safari** (must be Safari, not Chrome)
2. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up)
3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
4. Tap **"Add"** in the top-right
5. ‚ú® App icon appears on your home screen!

### On Android:

1. Open your app in **Chrome**
2. Tap the **menu** (three dots)
3. Tap **"Add to Home Screen"** or **"Install app"**
4. Follow the prompt
5. ‚ú® App appears in your app drawer!

## üöÄ Features You Get

‚úÖ **Install on Home Screen** - No app stores needed  
‚úÖ **Fullscreen Experience** - No browser UI when opened  
‚úÖ **Offline Support** - Works without internet connection  
‚úÖ **Fast Loading** - Service worker caching  
‚úÖ **Native Feel** - Appears like a real app

## üìÅ Files Created

- `/public/manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `/public/sw.js` - Service worker for offline support
- `/app/register-sw.js` - Auto-registers service worker
- `/instructions/PWA_SETUP.md` - Complete documentation
- `/public/create-icons.html` - Icon generator tool

## üîß What Changed

- Added PWA meta tags to `/app/layout.js`
- Service worker auto-registers on page load
- Configured for both iOS and Android
- Theme color set to FoundIt blue (#3686C7)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs only work over HTTPS in production (localhost works for testing)
2. **Icons Required**: App won't install properly without icons
3. **Safari for iOS**: Must use Safari browser on iOS (not Chrome)
4. **Clear Cache**: If testing changes, clear browser cache or increment cache version in `sw.js`

## üé® Customization

All PWA settings are in `/public/manifest.json`:

- Change app name, colors, display mode, etc.

Service worker caching strategy is in `/public/sw.js`:

- Currently set to "network-first, fallback to cache"

## ‚ú® Ready to Go!

Once you add the icons:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open on your phone
3. Install from browser menu
4. Launch from home screen
5. Enjoy native app experience!
